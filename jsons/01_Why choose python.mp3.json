    "text": " Alright guys, I hope you are having fun in this course. I am having fun. Today we are going to see Python Refresher. We will use Python programming language throughout this course. And I want to teach you Python well before we move towards complex concepts. Now here's the thing. I know that some of you already know Python. Some of you must have been like this who must have mastered Python very well and made good projects. You can skip this section in this way. But listen to me carefully. I will cover this section with the help of Jopeta Notebook. And the Python Refresher section I am going to give you, I will tell you many things from the starting and I will be a little fast paced in it. It's not like I will teach you the whole Python in the end to end. I won't do it in 10 to 12 hours. I don't want to waste your time. I know that as human beings our time is very limited. And in the least I will teach you because I will teach you data science here. And that's it. We will start and I don't recommend that you skip it. But again, if you don't want to revision of Python, you can skip it. But again, if you see this, you will get a good revision of Python. It's a fresh content. I have given the whole refresher of Python with the help of Jopeta Notebook. So here I want to start that we have chosen Python programming language and what are we going to cover in today's video. So first of all we are going to see the overview of Python. Then we will see the basics of Python. And I will tell you quickly why we are using Python for data science. I will tell you about key libraries and their uses. Then I will show you two very interesting real-world applications and case studies that I have compiled. So let's start. So here you can see why Python programming language is used by data scientists. Because it is very intuitive. It is easy to understand. And along with that, Python's history goes back to 1991. When Guido Van Roussam started this project in late 1980s. In 1991, he gave an official release of it. In 1992, the programming language was stable. And then the rest is history. And it was said that Python 2 was very popular. There was a lot of development in Python 2. And then what happened? There were some major problems in Python 2. Like the print take function was not there. There were many other things that we had to separate. A major rewrite of Python, Python 2-3. The transition of 2-3 was a big transition. And then there were small updates of Python. Like in F-Strengths, which is a way to write strings well. We will see that in this refresher. But Python is a very good programming language. And today, it is a very stable programming language. And AI and machine learning and data science is a proven programming language. If you want to do anything related to data science. If you want to do anything related to machine learning. This is the language for you. So Python is a very good language. The key characteristics of this is dynamic typing. You don't have to type. If you have learnt C in college. You will know that we have to write int, We have to write char. We have to tell all these things. This variable is of this type. And this can be stored in it. There is nothing like this in Python. Python is very flexible. If you write x is equal to 72. In the next line, you can write Harry in double code. And then the x that is after that. It will start holding the x string. So here, it gives a very big flexibility to Python. It is simple and readable. And the standard library is very extensive. Which means that there are many built-in packages in it. So you don't have to go anywhere. You can see a lot of things there. Along with this, the extended library is also very good. For data science, NAMPAI, PANDAS. We will see which other libraries are in it. Then the community support is very good. You get to see good conferences. Python has a big Picon conference. You can join it too. But again, you will get very good people there. And you will get data science enthusiasts. And I recommend that you go to Python events. But again, it is an active community. Talk about online community. Talk about offline conferences. You will get to see that too. Then the resources are very abundant. There is so much development in Python. If you search anything, Suppose you search that you will get a package for face recognition. Suppose you search for machine learning. Suppose you search a character detector. You have written anything. You will get to search for handwriting, some programs. You will search for anything on the internet. There is a good chance that you will get it in Python. If you search in C sharp, you may not get a stable library. You can use it in production. At least commercially, you will not be able to use it. But in Python, you will get well tested, well developed, well organized libraries. So these library tools are very abundant in Python. Then let's talk about the basics. Why is Python's syntax so beautiful? Why is Python's syntax so beautiful? First of all, it is intuitive. It is a print function. We have written a string in it. So it is easy to understand that this statement is going to print. You wrote C is equal to A plus B. There was no int, no care, no static typing. You don't have to mention that it is int, it is care. You don't have to do all that. If someone is reading, even if you have learned Python in 10 days, it also works well in Python. Then indentation is used. It means that there are no blackheads, you can easily indentation, that is, you can give some spaces and enter a particular block. We will see that in Python Refreshion. Now I want to talk about some libraries. And I won't take much time for you to take this introduction. I will tell you some libraries that you should know. What does it do? NumPy is used for numerical computing. And it is used to efficiently handle big arrays. Because Python is a nickname for being a slow programming language. It is very bad name. It is good and intuitive. I didn't do that much praise. It is all about things. But it is slow. You will write in C, it will be fast. It will be slow in Python. NumPy solves this problem. How to handle arrays well. According to this, you are doing computations at a very low level. Then comes the Pandas, data manipulation, reading in CSV, writing in CSV, it is used in all these things. Then comes the Matplotlib, it is used for data visualization. Then comes the C-Bond, it is used for statistical data visualization. Then comes the SciPy, it is used for advanced scientific computing. It is used for scikit-learn machine learning and data mining. It is used for deep learning neural networks in TensorFlow. It is similar in PyTorch. But PyTorch is different in TensorFlow. And the stats model is for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing. Then comes the XGBoost, it is used for high performance ML models. This is also a Python package. Again, you don't have to worry about these. When you use it, you will understand what is the package and what is the work and when and for what particular problem you have to use which package. All this will be cleared by you. So, you should know about these libraries. Now, we have already installed Python. If you follow along, you have a working version of Python. I will not install Python installer. I will not do it with Python.org. The reason for that is, I told you that in Jupyter, you get interactive coding. We can write code in chunks. And as we want to do it step by step, we will run the program. And if things are step by step, it becomes easy. Then, inline display of charts and graphs. A very good feature in the notebook. I made a variable A is equal to something. And I made B is equal to something. Then I made a data frame. Consider a cup-axle sheet in data frame. I am telling you to give an idea. Consider an excel sheet. Like excel data stores. It stores the entire data in a variable. Now, if you want to visualize it, I can write code directly in the cell and see its graph. To do this, I will have to run the entire program in VS code, PyCharm. So, I will want to run the program in chunks when I am doing data science. After this, in Anaconda, many packages are already installed. I don't need to install anything from the beginning. And I can make a virtual environment using any Python version. I have shown this to you. Environment management is very easy. Then, shareable notebooks. I made an iPython notebook. I can export it as a PDF and give it to you in a few days. And you can review it again. You can see it. These things make Jupiter and Anaconda very strong for data science. Alright. So, here are some real world applications. I will show you the case studies of Python. Python uses Spotify. Why does it use it? To do data science machine learning. And to deliver personalized music recommendation. It has been using Spotify for years. It also uses Netflix for its recommendation system. Python uses Dropbox as a core infrastructure. Python has a reliable cloud storage. Dropbox is a reliable cloud storage. If you know about Dropbox, and the infrastructure is used by Python a lot. Initially, Instagram was written in Python plus Django. Although, it has big services. It has different frameworks. It is not made in one particular thing. But Python is used with Django. And why is Django used? So that Python can access the data libraries. If I want to use Python packages, what will I do? Either I will use Django or Flask. Or I will use FastAPI. If you don't know what is Django, Flask and FastAPI, No need to worry about that. These three frameworks are in Python. To make web applications. Here, billions of active users use Python on Instagram. Moreover, Python uses its backend services. To use machine learning. Because you get packages like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch. And it uses all this because Python uses it. If you want to use Python's packages, it is a good idea to use Python for the backend. These were some case studies for Python. The thing is that Python is a powerful language for data science. We are going to use these in this course. These are ease of use. There are extensive libraries. The Python community is very big. I don't want to take your time. I will refresh you in the coming videos. But I want to point out that if you don't know Python, then my Udemy course which you will get here on the screen. You can take the best by using my YouTube bio or my Instagram bio. So that you get it at a very cheap price. I am going to add many projects here. If you want to learn Python in English and want to learn up to date, then I will recommend you to check out my Udemy course. I am going to add some A.I related projects. These are the pipelines and I will add them soon. You will get updated projects there. You can access them. I have already made free courses. If you have a course on Hindi on YouTube, you can access it. Python will come easily. Along with that, I will give you a handbook. You will get enough to revise Python. But if you take Udemy course, then there is an extensive handbook of Python. I have written that for a long time. If you access it, you can learn from scratch. We will go to the next video. We will hand on Python. We will write the actual code."
