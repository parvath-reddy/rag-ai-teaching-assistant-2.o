    "text": " Now we will see how to use the if else statement Plus we will also see the importance of the if else statement in data science As you can see, I have come into the computer screen And I save this ibyte notebook Plus I close the ibyte notebook So you can close it by clicking on the close other tabs You can do all these things Here we will see the conditional statements in the Python What are the things that are used First of all, we have to make some things in a particular condition In Python or in any programming language But if we are talking about Python here We will only see Python-specific things If there are else statements in Python Which help you to work according to a particular condition I will keep things a little fast-paced Because I have already told you that this is a refresher of Python This is not a course of Python Here I have a variable I have said a is equal to I have done something like this a is equal to 4 Now I am saying if a is greater than 53 And after that I will put this in the indentation Because this is the first introduction of our indentation We have not used indentation yet We are using indentation for the first time If I am writing something like this If a is greater than 53 And I will put a colon and enter You will notice that the enter here Is not bringing the cursor here It is bringing a tab here When we give a tab like this Python interpreter will understand that If is greater than 53 So we have come into the if statement Here a tab means Or I will say indentation Some people indent it by doing 4 spaces Some people indent it by tapping Both are right Here we will enter If I do backspace here This is the tab If I enter here I have come And I am in the if statement So if I say if a is greater than 53 Then print here Greater Okay And I will enter and backspace Else Print it smaller It is simple It is a simple program I will enter and shift Output is smaller Why? Why is the output smaller? Because the value of A was 4 But if it was 400 Then what would we have? I will enter and shift again So we have got greater If else we can do Pro-Gramming If it is greater than 53 Then print this Or print this As simple as that Once again I will keep things very simple And short Because I want you to dive in data science We will not waste much time in learning basic python Now if I write something like this If A is greater than 5 Then this is valid I have put a parenthesis here But it is not necessary You can write it directly If A is greater than 5 Although I prefer parenthesis Reason being That things are organized with parenthesis Plus if I want to complicate the expression That is, A is greater than 53 If I want to complicate Then it becomes easy to read for humans For example, if I write A is greater than 53 So if I will keep parenthesis Then it will be easy to read things Chances of error Chances of error of humans will be reduced So I have written this program here And I am changing the value of A here Now let's understand how it works Whenever we have if, elif, elif and else Then we call it if else ladder Whatever I have selected here It will all be executed together When I say it will be executed together What does it mean? This means that this if, elif, elif and else This is a whole ladder If any of these conditions are true Then execution will stop there For example, if value 41 is here Then first of all this condition will be checked Is it greater than 50? No Is it greater than 40? Yes So here this elif will be executed And it will go straight after our else That means, out of all these statements Which I have selected Out of all these statements Only one statement will be executed I hope you are understanding And able to understand how it works Here I have done 1 of 41 So it will be greater than 40 Because this condition was false This condition was true And it was printed Now if I do something like this I say 29 And if I enter shift Then it will be done here Why? Because this condition was not true This condition was not true This condition was not also true Finally elf's content was executed If I do 33 Then we will have greater than 30 Because this condition was false This also became false But this condition was true Because of which greater than 30 It was printed on the screen I hope you are understanding this So in this way our if-else statements work I have written for you very well If-else, elif, if It is well summarized All these if-else, by the notebooks You will get them for download So you don't have to make any notes No need to worry All these conditions Work in conjunction Work together So what is the use of if-else in data science Now look, in data science To filter us, to clean the data To make decisions This is how the statements are needed We will read about the Pandas data frame About which I am not telling you right now I will tell you quickly But I just want to tell you that In Pandas data frame How can we put conditions We will read all these things But again, I have given you an example So that if you are doing revision You will be able to connect the dots I hope you are understanding The if is executed when the condition is true You can use the if alone You can use the if with else And with a lot of elif Or with just one elif And then you can use it with the else And it handles multiple conditions Now we will see how functions work in Python The way to make functions in Python is very simple You simply have to use the def keyword For example, I made a function called defavg I can pass two arguments in it If I want, I can pass five arguments And I can return a plus b divided by 2 So this function will average me Two numbers For example, if 4 and 6 are 5 Then it is giving me 5.0 Now if I want to give b as default value Then I can modify this function If b's default value is zero Suppose I have kept it under my condition If I don't pass another value Then it is zero Or 10, you can do anything It is your wish So what will happen? If I take out the average of 4 and 6 Then it will be 5 But if I take out the average of only 4 Then it will automatically consider the other value 10 And it will do 10 plus 4 by 2 which is 7 So it is called default arguments So we can pass multiple arguments We can keep some default arguments in the function And one thing you have to keep in mind That the default arguments you will pass in the function Will be in the last The function of your function is giving you 5 arguments Out of which there are two default arguments A, B and C are your regular arguments And D and E are your default arguments So D and E will be kept at the end Because they are default arguments Meaning you are giving them value So you will write the function according to that I hope you understood how the function works And how to call a function If you want you can write a function Which is not taking anything Like I am printing in this function Hello, good morning Okay, I am writing this So I can do something like this I will call Greed So he will print Hello, good morning What will Greed do? Greed will not return anything Because I did not return anything from Greed So if I am going to print A is equal to Greed And if I print Greed then I will get none So when Python does not return anything We call it none None is an object in Python Which is useful to depict That the function is not returning anything So whenever we do not have to write anything In Python we write none Like N-O-N So you should know this And you can see that this is highlighted in green color Because this is the keyword reserved in Python So I hope you understood how to use functions How to use conditionals I hope you are enjoying this course You are enjoying this course See you in the next video"
