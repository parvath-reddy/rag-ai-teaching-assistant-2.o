This means that if you have a variable and you want to match it in different cases, then you can easily do it. Let's go to the computer screen and see how it will be clear. So here I have made a new Jupyter notebook to save time, which is called 07 underscore matchcase.iponb. And here I have told you about the match case. So the match case statement that was introduced in Python 3.10, this pattern matching allows for a particular variable. If you are coming from C language, you will know about the switch. In C language, it is taught in B-Tech in the first year in India, so I am referring to it. In C language, as you can see the switch statement, most of the cases, everyone has seen it. Switch statements work the same way. The syntax is something like this. Suppose there is a variable called code, whose value can be 200, 400, 400, 400, or 500. What we do here is that we match each and every one of them. Suppose there is a code value here, the value of the code is 500. Now I want to write a syntax like this, which means that I match the code. And I am saying something like this, that the code can be of 200, so what if it is of 200? If the value is of 400, then what is it? Suppose the value is 200, then what will I do here? I will write case 200. If it is 200, then I will print it from the letter. The response is okay. If you do not know about HTTP codes, then I will tell you that the HTTP codes tell us the response of our request. For example, the 200 means okay, 400 means bad request, 404 means 400, not found, okay? And 500 is an internal server error. So we do this. First of all, we will write another case here. We will say case 400, if it is, then print it, bad response, bad response. And here I will write another case here, which is 404. And I will write print here, and I will write not found. Okay? And here I will print like this, end of program. Okay? So here I will close it like this. And I will print shift enter, so here end of program is printed. Because I did not make a case of 500. So how did this code work? How did this code work? First of all, it matched case 200. If it was 200, then it would have been printed, response is okay. Or I will say that if the case 200 was matched, then this code would have been executed. Which is one line right now, but it could have been multiple lines. For example, I will write a good job here. I mean, our okay response comes when we believe it normal. In most of the cases, when we are browsing the internet, then we expect the response okay. That's why the internet works right.

When the case was 200, then we printed the response. And good job. If the case was 400, then this was printed. This was printed. This time I will do 200.
