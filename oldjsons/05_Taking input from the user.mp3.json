"text": " See you in the next video."}], "text": " Now we will see how to take input from user. I have come to my computer screen and you can see here I have made a Jupyter notebook 04 underscore input dot ipynb. So if I want to take input from user, then there is an input function in which I can write prompt like enter the value of a. Now the concept that I am going to tell you in this video is very important because this thing is very confused by people. If I press shift enter, then it is asking me for a value so I will say 45. I have written 45 and entered. If I print a now, then you will get 45 in a. Now here I will do the same thing for b. Enter the value of b. We will print a value like this. I will enter shift and enter b value. After that I will simply show a plus b. Then I will show a plus b. And you will feel that 49 is not good. If you do not know the concept, then you will feel that 49 is not good. But suddenly you will come to know that it is 5454. How is it 454? Because when there are two strings, then the plus operator concatenates them. And this is what we are getting to see here. This is the concatenation of the strings. So to correct this thing, because if you want 49 output then you will not do a and b plus. You will do it. I will show you here. If you do a and b plus, then 454 will come. But I will tell you what to do. You have to do int of a plus int of b. That is, we type cast a to integer. Then we type cast b to integer. And we have added these two. So int of a plus int of b, we got 49. So this is our int a plus int b. After doing 49, this is our input function. So we can take a user input as a string. So I will write it here. I will write it here. By default it takes user input as string. What does by default do? It takes user input as a string. Now what I will do here? By default it takes user input as string. And if I run it from top to bottom. And obviously I will have to put value here. 45 and I will put here 6. I will enter shift. I entered 6. And b value came 6. And now I entered shift. So it came 6. And this came 456. And this came 51. So you should know this. And that was how you can take input from a user. Now I will tell you one more thing. If I write c is equal to input. I write only this much. Even then we can take c value. If I write 67 here. It means there is no need for prompt. But it is always a good idea to give prompt. Because you see the difference. When we were giving prompt here. We wrote prompt here. So we are getting to know what input is being asked. But if I show you here. By running this. So here it is called pending input. So I put 67 here. And here if I enter this. So you see here. Without any prompt value. So I will give 45. So in c45 as a string will be assigned. But the thing is. It won't be good. It won't give good user experience to your user. So yeah. That was about input function in python. I hope you are enjoying this course. In the upcoming videos. We will explore more python concepts. See you in the next video."}
