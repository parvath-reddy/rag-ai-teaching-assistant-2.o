Presidents which kind of Operator will go into the first Python programming So you can see I have come to my computer screen and here I have written an Operator Presidents in Python I will name it a little better So I will click here and press F2 and I will write 05 underscore operator underscore precedence dot ipynv which is the extension of the IPython notebook So you don't have to worry about downloading the IPython notebook just understand the things you want to note down Now here you can see Operator Presidents works in Python We have heard about the board mass If you have studied a little in your childhood you will know what is the board mass The board mass means that the bracket is first resolved then after that the power and the roots are solved then after that division, then multiplication, then addition then addition, then subtraction Similarly, in Python, first the parenthesis is resolved then the exponents are resolved then multiplication and division that is the same of these two The same is the case with the previous two which is followed and then addition and subtraction So let's look at the example Suppose the result is equal to 10 plus 2 multiplied by 3 Now here first multiplication and division if anything is there then it will be resolved that is 10 plus 6 and we will get 16 So if I hit shift enter here and then write the result then you will get to see that 16 output is already there If I put a bracket here like this then 10 plus 2 will be resolved first and then 3 will be resolved So here 12 multiplied by 3 which is 36, it will be done but if we have two operators here then what will happen? 2 multiplied by 3 sorry 2 to the power 3 to the power 2 So here first our rightmost exponentiation will work So here 3 double star 2 first then 9 will be done then 2 to the power 9 and 512 will be the result Now I will write a random thing here I will write a very random calculation I know I wrote here 3 divided by 23 after this I wrote 4 minus 2 and now if you ask me what will be the answer to this and suppose we do the 5 to the power 5 to spice things up then what will happen? how will things work here? So first we will work on exponents there is no parenthesis so first we will resolve the exponents So if I show you the result of this by entering shift enter then how it is coming? So first we will resolve 2 to the power 5 then what will happen? 2 to the power 5 is 32 so this will be 32 so this will be converted to this obviously the result will also be same after this we will see what is the multiplication division we have here yes we have multiplication and division so what will happen here? that this will go the first multiplication that is coming first that is left to right our left to right multiplication is so what will happen to 54 multiplied by 3? 54 multiplied by 3 is 162 so we will replace this with 162 and 162 divided by 23 plus 4 minus 32 this will happen and after this we will do division which will be 162 divided by 23 whatever is 162 divided by 23 I will calculate this in a new tab this is 7.04 something let us consider 7.04 let us consider it as 7.04 let us consider 7.04 after this we will do plus 4 minus 32 and after this the calculation is very simple and this is minus 20.95 something like this has come so some kind of operator precedence works in python so in order of evolution so the exponentiation is right to left our left to right does not work but when we have multiplication division floor division modules all these go to left to right and I have given the example here you can see it when you have seen this example you must have seen why it is going to right to left the reason is that the exponentiation goes right to left in python and this question is very much asked in this interview people make it wrong many people make the wrong output which is not expected from you as a leader scientist so you have to keep this in mind and many people who think python comes, these are small things they will get to learn from this python refresher so if I talk about summary then the most precedence of exponentiation is right to left and our multiplication division floor division modules is lower precedence from exponentiation and this is left to right so I hope you are getting a lot of learning from this python refresher in the next video we will understand more details see you in the next video"}
