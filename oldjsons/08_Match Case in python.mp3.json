the match case works in Python programming. Match case, if else, makes it a little easier for some cases. What does this mean? This means that if you have a variable and you want to match it in different cases, then you can easily do it. Let's go to the computer screen and see how it will be clear. So here I have made a new Jupyter notebook to save time, which is called 07 underscore matchcase.iponb. And here I have told you about the match case. So the match case statement that was introduced in Python 3.10, this pattern matching allows for a particular variable. If you are coming from C language, you will know about the switch. In C language, it is taught in B-Tech in the first year in India, so I am referring to it. In C language, as you can see the switch statement, most of the cases, everyone has seen it. Switch statements work the same way. The syntax is something like this. Suppose there is a variable called code, whose value can be 200, 400, 400, 400, or 500. What we do here is that we match each and every one of them. Suppose there is a code value here, the value of the code is 500. Now I want to write a syntax like this, which means that I match the code. And I am saying something like this, that the code can be of 200, so what if it is of 200? If the value is of 400, then what is it? Suppose the value is 200, then what will I do here? I will write case 200. If it is 200, then I will print it from the letter. The response is okay. If you do not know about HTTP codes, then I will tell you that the HTTP codes tell us the response of our request. For example, the 200 means okay, 400 means bad request, 404 means 400, not found, okay? And 500 is an internal server error. So we do this. First of all, we will write another case here. We will say case 400, if it is, then print it, bad response, bad response. And here I will write another case here, which is 404. And I will write print here, and I will write not found. Okay? And here I will print like this, end of program. Okay? So here I will close it like this. And I will print shift enter, so here end of program is printed. Because I did not make a case of 500. So how did this code work? How did this code work? First of all, it matched case 200. If it was 200, then it would have been printed, response is okay. Or I will say that if the case 200 was matched, then this code would have been executed. Which is one line right now, but it could have been multiple lines. For example, I will write a good job here. I mean, our okay response comes when we believe it normal. In most of the cases, when we are browsing the internet, then we expect the response okay. That's why the internet works right. So here see that the code is equal to 500, the shift enter is done. The shift enter is done again. And here see that the code is equal to 500. We matched the code. When the case was 200, then we printed the response. And good job. If the case was 400, then this was printed. This was printed. This time I will do 200. And I will show you by hitting shift enter that these two lines are printed. So the case is 200 because it matched. So the code that was in the case 200, it was executed. As you can see here, response okay. Good job. The case was not executed because the code was not 400. It was not even 404. Now sometimes we want to, as we know, we have done 2000. Now I will run it. So it will go straight to the end of the program. There will be no code execution from here. So what do we do now? Sometimes we want that if any value is not matched, then show something. Like here we have done the case and the score. So for that we use underscore. So whenever I write case underscore underscore, and I will write nothing matched here. Okay. So now I will enter the shift. So look, nothing matches because the value of the code is 2000. We could have done this with F statement. So why did we use the match case? Sometimes the code is, its readability also matters a lot. For example, reading this code is very easy. When I say match code, then I understand that I am matching the code name variable. And when I make cases, it is very clear. It is very clear that if the code value is 200, then these lines will be executed. If the code value is 400, then this line will be executed. If the code value is 404, then this line will be executed. If nothing matches, then this line will be executed. And this will be executed only because this is outside the match case. So this is how the match case works. Really very important concept. We will use it very much in data science. I hope you have enjoyed this course so far. See you in the next video."}
