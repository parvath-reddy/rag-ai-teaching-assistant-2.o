"text": " Today we will see F string score in Python programming Let's go into the computer screen and understand things well I have already made a Jupyter notebook for you guys I will name it as F string and I will tell you about it The string is arguably the most used data types in Python Now let me explain the meaning of this string If you have made a string and you have written s is equal to Harry If you want to access it, you can do it this way If you do s1, you will get to see it If you write s1, you will get to see it this way And so on But can you do something like this? S0 is equal to... I can put a second character here I can put p here You can't The reason for that is that string is immutable Here you see that string object does not support item assignment There is an error Why did this error occur? Because you can't change the string But wait a minute We had seen string methods We were able to change the string there No, we were not able to change the string If I had written s is equal to Harry And then I have written s.upper So here I am not changing the s If you print s again Then it is the same as s A new string makes a new string No matter what method it is In most of the cases If you run any string method Then you get a new string Which is changed version of original string But what is the original string changed? The answer is no Immutable means that In Python, it is impossible to change the string You can't change the string You can make a new string Which will be updated version of this string But you can't change existing string So it is very important to know this thing for you Now we will see how to do string formatting Look at this code Here we have written name is equal to Alice Age is equal to 25 Now you can see here I want my name is Alice and I am 25 years old So here it is written So for this, there is a format function And we run the format in a way that You give any string You run dot format on it And the values you give Will be here Wherever you have put curly braces It will fit there Like in this case Your new string will be My name is Alice and I am 25 years old If I want to generate many strings like this So what I will have to do is I will have to write my name is John And my name is John I am 25 years old Now if you consider that John is 45 or 55 So if you run it like this Then you will get this string change So sometimes we have to make a template And we have to insert different values in that template And for that we use the format method So this is an old way To do string formatting in Python That it works today Yes, it works today But Python 3.6 onwards A very good way came And its name is f string What we do is We will write a statement like this directly We will say that If you are printing So directly write print statement Something like this And put an f here Which has become an f string And insert the values here For example, I will write the name of the variable here My name is name And I am age years old I will hit shift enter So this string will be my variable And it will come after printing So if you want to insert a variable In a string Then you can use f string like this And that's pretty much about f strings You can write an expression in f string You can calculate anything here A plus B A minus B You can do multiplication in this You can insert a new variable directly You can do all these things You can do formatting here For example, here you see the value of pi 3.14159 You want to get only 2 decimal places So you will write pi and you will write dot 2f So you will get only 2 decimal places So you can use the variable like this You can change the variable and print it And you can do this very conveniently Now you can see here That we can do padding and alignment like this I will tell you what this means If you will write something like this You wrote python And you wrote colon I will execute a new code If I execute this directly You will feel what did I do This is not printing python But if I will show you all these lines With one hand, you will know Basically, whenever I am writing So I am basically saying That align left That is, align this string Align left Such that This is left in the width of 10 characters I will show you these three lines Then you will understand easily So here we have taken total width of 10 characters And within that we are moving python Sometimes we are align left Sometimes we are align right We are align center If I will hit shift enter You will understand This is the width of our 10 characters This is the width of our 10 characters If you count characters from here, then it will be 10 Now when I am writing the first line I have written the string colon less than 10 I am saying here that Align left In a total character width of length 10 Okay And here I have said Align center with the width of 10 characters So we can align a particular word Align left and right And such things are very useful In command line games So you should know this Those who have skipped python refreshers There is a good chance that they don't know all these things So in the beginning I had suggested That don't skip lectures And don't skip any lectures Take time and learn So you can learn So you can learn So you can learn So your foundation will be strong I hope this video is helpful I have written a line here Which explains what it is doing Column less than 10 This symbol means That left align the text within a total width of 10 characters Okay And f strings are the most efficient And recommended ways of formatting a string in python If you want to format strings in modern python I will suggest you to use f string Don't use dot format I am saying directly Because f string is an easy and intuitive way Easy to read way Python 3.6 is introduced Which is a very good thing I will call python 3.6 old There are new versions of python in today's series I hope you understood See you in the next video"}
