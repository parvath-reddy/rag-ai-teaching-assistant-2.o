"text": " We will talk about Loops in Python And I will quickly take you to the computer screen So that we can learn things in very good code I have made a file named 0900 in the name of Loops So that you can see And here we have two types of Mail Loops in Python One is For Loop and one is While Loop For Loop means we iterate over a sequence If you don't know what the list is Then you shouldn't look at Python Refreshers You should learn a Python code So I assume that you know what the list is in Python So the collection of different data types is the same The same data type can also be done Here we have taken a list of off-routes And we can iterate like this So if I have some numbers, let us say L is equal to Here I have written L is equal to 3, 5, 6 And one more, let me say 67 So I can print 4 items in L and print them And all the items will be printed in 3, 5, 6 and 67 This is called I Trating the Loop And I can print all the items by iterating the loop Or I can do something else with it So this is our For Loop After this we have a For Loop with Range Let us say I want to print all the numbers from 0 to 100 So I will write For I in Range And I will do 10 here And I will print I here Now the question that will be asked in the interview Is what will be its output Its output starts from 0 to 9 Many people tell the answer from 0 to 10 And the answer of the question is wrong So if I print Shift Enter, it goes from 0 to 9 If you want 10 to 0, you have to write 11 in the range Like a rule of thumb, you can think that Range n goes from 0 to n minus 1 And if you want to start from 1, you can do something like this Like if I in Range 1 comma 10 So now it will go from 1 to 9 So if I want to run the loop from 1 to 10 Then I will do something like this And my loop will go from 1 to 10 I can start this loop from 5 So I will do 5 comma 11 in the range So it will go from 5 to 10 And so on You can iterate till your favorite range You are saying that Take 5 to 10 Alright, so this was our For Loop with Range So For Loop is a very simple thing It is a very basic thing You have to iterate a sequence Or you have to produce a range of numbers So this is For Loop Now we will see the While Loop What is the While Loop The While Loop is a loop that runs as long as the condition is true For example, here I have initially zeroed the count Then I am saying that until the count is smaller than 3 While count is less than 3 You print it And along with that, I am updating the count I am increasing the count from 1 So initially the count value was zero Count is less than 3 Yes, then it will go into the loop It will print the count which is zero And after that it will make the count one Then it will run again What is 1 less than 3 Yes, it will be one print It will make the count 2 It will run again What is 2 less than 3 Yes, it will print the count Which is 2 It will stop the loop And the loop execution will end And this output will come So this is how the While Loop works So if I write a While Loop example I will write While I is less than 12 I will say print I No, not I And I will write I is equal to I plus 1 And I will initialize it from zero And try to guess the output by yourself So here I have written I is equal to zero So it will run from zero And the I value will increase Finally I value will be 11 So 11 will be less than 12 And 11 will be printed Then I value will be 12 So it will go from zero to 11 So you should do its dry run And try to understand how it works Because it is very essential For you to understand How it works Awesome, so this is our While Loop Now we understand about Loop Control Statements Which is Break, Continue and Pass Sometimes I have to write Loop I wrote For, Item and L And I want to see it later I want to put it I want to say that I will write this loop later Let's do something else So if I leave it like this And I start writing my code So what will happen I will execute it, so this will be the error But I want to write this loop later So I can write Pass And Pass means do nothing Pass means do nothing So I can do it like this I can put it in function I can put it in loops So Pass means do nothing Pass it And here Print Hello Awesome We have a Break statement Like I have a loop For one list L is equal to We have apples Bananas And then tomatoes And I want For, Item and L And I want Print Item Print Item If I enter Shift, all these will be printed But I want If the item is Bananas Then stop there And finish the execution of the loop So I can write If Item is equal to Equals to Bananas So what I want to do I want to do a Break So I have said For Item and L This condition will be false Apples will be printed Bananas will be printed This condition will be true And this will be a Break This means finish the loop here And don't execute it So I will enter Shift I have already done the Break Now if I continue The case of Continue It happens like this Skip this iteration So what does Break mean? I write it here So that this notebook will work well For revision I write Stop this loop right here So finish this loop here Pass means Don't do anything And Continue means Stop Stop This particular I iteration Of the loop So when I continue I am saying that Print Apple Because this condition is false Then when the item value will be Bananas Then this condition will be true And it will continue Whenever there is a continuous statement So what will happen? We skip this iteration And execute the next iteration So the iteration of Tomatoes will be executed And Apples and Tomatoes will be printed So I skipped Bananas I write it as Skip Stop Skip this particular iteration of the loop Better wording So it breaks Stop this loop I have written Loop right here And Continue So let's continue the break And do the pass statements I hope you understood And I could explain How Break works How Continue works How Pass works How Loops works I hope you understand See you in the next video"}
