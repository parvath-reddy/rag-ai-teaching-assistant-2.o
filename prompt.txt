I am teaching Python fundamentals in my data science course. 
Here are video subtitle chunks (title, number, start, end, text):
[{"title":"Why choose python","number":"1","start":72.56,"end":86.8,"text":" So here I want to start that we have chosen Python programming language and what are we going  to cover in today's video.  So first of all we are going to see the overview of Python.  Then we will see the basics of Python.  And I will tell you quickly why we are using Python for data science."},{"title":"Why choose python","number":"1","start":612.92,"end":622.92,"text":" The thing is that Python  is a powerful language for data science.  We are going to use these in this course.  These are ease of use.  There are extensive libraries."},{"title":"Why choose python","number":"1","start":86.8,"end":102.8,"text":" I will tell you about key libraries and their uses.  Then I will show you two very interesting real-world applications and case studies that I have compiled.  So let's start.  So here you can see why Python programming language is used by data scientists.  Because it is very intuitive."},{"title":"Variables data types and typecasting","number":"2","start":0.0,"end":23.6,"text":" So with full enthusiasm, we will start Python programming.  First of all, I want to tell you that this Python refresher will be short to the point  and you will be able to start it with data science.  Not just this course, whenever I study, my motive is that I should at least understand you more.  So here, as you can see, I have made a folder in the name of data science course."},{"title":"Why choose python","number":"1","start":161.92,"end":172.92,"text":" If you want to do anything related to data science.  If you want to do anything related to machine learning.  This is the language for you.  So Python is a very good language.  The key characteristics of this is dynamic typing."}]

"why data science for python "
Answer naturally: explain where this topic is taught, mention video number and timestamps,
and guide the user to go to that particular video. 
If the question is unrelated to the course, politely say you can only answer course-related questions.
