The topic "why data science for python" is actually the reverse of what we've covered so far. We've discussed "why choose python" for data science, which is a key concept in our course.

You can find this topic covered in Video 1, "Why choose python". Specifically, you can refer to the following timestamps:

- 72.56-86.8: Introduction to the overview of Python and its basics
- 86.8-102.8: Discussion on why Python is used by data scientists and its intuitive nature
- 161.92-172.92: Explanation of Python's key characteristics, such as dynamic typing, and its relevance to data science and machine learning
- 612.92-622.92: Overview of Python's benefits, including ease of use and extensive libraries

To learn more, I recommend going to Video 1, "Why choose python", and watching these sections to understand why Python is a popular choice for data science.
